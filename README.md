# Encryption/Decryption

This project is the part of one of course in B.tech CSE.

Security is major concern these days. Keeping this real life problem in mind we have decided
to make a tool which can encrypt and decrypt a specific file.

# File format: 
Our code supports encryption and decryption of simple text files and images.

Coding Language: Java

# Techniques: The algorithms that have been used by us include
1.) Caesar Cipher - It is a type of substitution cipher in which each letter in the plaintext is 'shifted' a certain number of places down the alphabet. For example, with a shift of 1, A would be replaced by B, B would become C, and so on.

2.)Vigenere Cipher â€“ It is a method of encrypting alphabetic text by using a series of interwoven Caesar ciphers based on the letters of a keyword. It is a form of polyalphabetic substitution.

3.)Transposition Cipher - Also called columns permutation, is a technique to change the order of the letters in a text by placing it in a grid. In this method of encryption by which the positions are held by units of plaintext (which are commonly characters or groups of characters) are shifted according to a regular system, so that the ciphertext constitutes a permutation of the plaintext.

4.)Image Encryption/Decryption - In this encryption and decryption of images is done using a secret-key block cipher called 64-bits Blowfish designed to increase security and to improve performance. This algorithm will be used as a variable key size up to 448 bits.
